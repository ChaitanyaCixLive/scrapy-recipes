This document includes some ideas and lines of work to improve the test. I prefered to deliver a finished code than leaving it unfinished but addressing more features.

* Duplicates: The crawler retrieves the recipes in one pass but it should only be run once, since it doesn't make any duplicate control.
* Image storing: I researched how to store images in MongoDB properly but I didn't found a neat solution in the given time.
* Multiple images: I assumed that every recipe had only an image in the recipe, but there at least two recipes without image and several - around 35 with more than 1 image.
* No specific performance test or development has been made. There are several areas were efficiency can be improved, for instance the code
* Cleaning html: Some paragraphs are scraped as list, to preserve the style of the text, but due to children tags - anchors for example - some paragraphs are not properly sliced.
